# Codes

I am a problem solving and research enthusiast. I love to solve algorithm/data structure problems on internet.

I have copied some of my codes here with its binaries. These problems were taken and solved at some of the websites like hackerrank, leetcode etc.

I will soon update my other codes in same genere and may be also from my research interests. My research interests is in Data Science that covers NLP, Big Data Analytics, Data Mining, Text Analytics, Machine Learning etc.
