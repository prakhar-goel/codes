# Codes

I am a problem solving and research enthusiast. I love to solve and design problems on algorithm/data structure/data science.

I have copied some of my codes of problems that I solved on internet. These problems were taken and solved at some of the websites like hackerrank, leetcode etc.

I am updating my other codes in my research interest too. My research interest is in Data Science that covers NLP, Big Data Analytics, Data Mining, Text Analytics, Machine Learning etc.
